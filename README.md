# Time series analysis plotting for both stationary and non stationary

This repository contains two R scripts demonstrating core concepts and initial analysis techniques for time series data.

ploting time series analysis statinary and non statinary.R: Generates and visualizes synthetic stationary and non-stationary time series, alongside their Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plots. This script helps illustrate the fundamental differences between these series types.
basic.R: Performs foundational exploratory data analysis and stationarity testing on R's built-in lh (luteinizing hormone) dataset.

Basics of R: Loads the lh dataset, visualizes it, provides summary statistics, and performs an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity.
ploting tsa statinary and non statinary.R: Generates examples of stationary and non-stationary (with trend) time series. It then plots both the series and their ACFs to highlight visual and statistical distinctions.
